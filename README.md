# 🧮 Calculator Web App

## 🚀 Project Overview and Learning Outcomes

This was my first project, where I gained hands-on experience in front-end development. By following a YouTube tutorial, I learned how to use Visual Studio Code and built a solid understanding of how HTML structures a webpage, how CSS customises its appearance, and how JavaScript adds interactivity to improve the user experience.

Through this project, I implemented functionality that allows the calculator to track user inputs and perform mathematical operations. This experience taught me the power of JavaScript in making web applications dynamic, and how essential these technologies are for creating a cohesive, interactive product.

Although this project was a simple introduction to front-end development, it has sparked my curiosity for more complex projects and deeper learning in web development.
